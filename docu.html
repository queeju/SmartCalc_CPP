<h2 id="description-of-the-project-">Description of the project:</h2>
<p>This program is a versatile calculator that allows users to perform various calculations, including evaluating arithmetic expressions, plotting graphs of functions, and calculating credits. The program provides an intuitive user interface to enter expressions and view the results.</p>
<h2 id="arithmetic-expression-evaluation-">Arithmetic Expression Evaluation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users can enter arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation using common arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulus.</li>
<li>The calculator accurately evaluates the expressions up to 13 decimal places and can handle expressions up to 255 characters.</li>
<li>It supports mathematical functions such as cosine, sine, tangent, arc cosine, arc sine, arc tangent, square root, natural logarithm, and common logarithm.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graph-plotting-">Graph Plotting:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users can plot graphs of functions given in infix notation with the variable &#39;x&#39;.</li>
<li>The program provides a user-friendly coordinate system with marked scales and an adaptive grid.</li>
<li>User can use scroll wheel to zoom in and out and drag the image to move along the grid.</li>
<li>The domain and codomain of the function are limited to the range from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000, but the user can specify the displayed domain and codomain for plotting.</li>
<li>To create the image of the plot, user must input the equation, click the graph icon ad click &quot;plot&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="credit-calculator-">Credit Calculator:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The program includes a special mode known as the &quot;credit calculator.&quot;</li>
<li>Users can input details like the total credit amount, term (duration), interest rate, and type of credit (annuity or differentiated).</li>
<li>Based on the input, the calculator provides information such as the monthly payment, overpayment on credit, and total payment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deposit-calculator-">Deposit Calculator:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The deposit profitability calculator is a specialized mode within the SmartCalc program designed to help users analyze the potential returns and outcomes of various deposit scenarios. </li>
<li>It enables users to input specific parameters related to their deposit accounts and receive comprehensive information about the accrued interest, and final deposit amount at the end of the term.</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculator offers great flexibility and accuracy, making it suitable for various mathematical computations and financial calculations. Users can efficiently evaluate complex arithmetic expressions, visualize functions&#39; graphs, and make informed financial decisions using the credit calculator mode. With its user-friendly interface and accurate results, the program caters to a wide range of mathematical and financial needs.</p>
